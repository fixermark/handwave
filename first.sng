Song format, loose description

Songs are lists of the following form:

(song (initial-assignments) cmd-a cmd-b cmd-c ...)

(initial-assignments) is a starting (assign...) command that lists all 16 notes. It is an error to list less than 16

Where cmd-a, cmd-b, cmd-c etc. are commands as follows:

- (assign 0 c4 1 c#4 2 d4 3 d#4 ...)

Assignment of notes to handwaves. 0 is the "highest" handwave in the list
